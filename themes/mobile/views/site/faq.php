                    <p>
                        Do you think people want to be on their favorite TV shows?  Youtoo has an app for that!  Youtoo is the only Social TV platform that allows viewers to participate in television programming from virtually any location. Youtoo’s patent-pending technology allows viewers to record high-definition, television-ready video files (we call them Fame Spots™), using the Youtoo app on smart phones and tablets, or from Youtoo.com, using computer webcams.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <h3>2) What is a Fame Spot™? Who can see it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Fame Spot™ is a 15-second video that you can record using our app or from the web at Youtoo.com.  Simply select a favorite show in which you’d like to see yourself, create your Fame Spot™ in response to that episode’s topic, and then submit it to us.  We will review it for regulatory & editorial compliance.  As soon as your Fame Spot™ is approved, we’ll notify you.  Once it has been scheduled on a television show, we will contact you again letting you know when to tune in with your friends! When it airs on Youtoo TV, everybody across the country watching the channel will see your Fame Spot™.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <h3>3) How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Youtoo’s patent-pending technology allows viewers to record high-definition, television-ready Fame Spots™ using our app on smart phones and tablets, or from Youtoo.com, using computer webcams.  Viewers then submit their video files to Youtoo TV for broadcast consideration.  The system electronically filters users’ videos to ensure they comply with our broadcast standards before sending them to our television producers who will review and select the best Fame Spots™ for inclusion on Youtoo TV’s original and syndicated television programs.  Once selected, our system will automatically deliver a Fame Spot™ (in the correct file format, bit rate and frame rate) to our television uplink facilities and insert the Fame Spot™ directly into pre-determined slots in the broadcast feeds without the need for an edit bay or additional intervention from broadcast facility personnel.  Because we have automated and streamlined the entire process, we can get a viewer’s Fame Spot™ up on the air in just a few short minutes…making viewer participation a reality for a national television audience.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <h3>4) What are Youtoo’s broadcast standards?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Certain things we simply can’t broadcast over our channel.  A few obvious violations include the use of profanity or vulgarity, hate speech, expressions of racism or bigotry, and anything that implies or otherwise advocates pornography, pedophilia, incest, or bestiality.  Other violations might be less obvious; like the use of copyrighted material (that’s how lawyers say photos, videos, graphics, music, or recorded sounds that you do not personally own).  In other words, you may want to have your favorite song playing in the background of your Fame Spot, but if you are not the owner of that song, we can’t air it.  On the other hand, if you wrote it, recorded it, published it, and can prove you own all the rights to it, knock yourself out.  We hope to add the capability to add your favorite songs to your Fame Spots in the future, but we don’t offer it today.

To find out, go to the find Youtoo TV section of Youtoo.com to see if we are available in your area.  You will simply need to enter your zip code and we will let you know where to find us in your area.  If we are not carried in your area and you wish to receive Youtoo TV, we will ask you to answer two more questions that will allow us to tell your cable provider that you want your SocialTV.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>Yes, by using Youtoo credits at Youtoo.com, you will be able to purchase your Youtoo aircheck.  It is a digital video file you can embed into all of your social media outlets so your friends and family can see how you were on TV.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>Youtoo.com has built virtual economy and gaming concepts into the Youtoo.com social network. Within this "virtual economy", Youtoo will offer users the opportunity either to purchase or to earn Youtoo credits.   These credits may then be exchanged for virtual goods and services within the social network.  This could range from buying "social shouts" on air to purchasing customized profile pages within the social network.     <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>Think of it as "text messaging" for your TV.  Instead of "messaging" your friends one at a time with your phone, you will be messaging the entire TV audience.  We call these messages Social Shouts.  Not only will your message be seen on TV, it will be seen simultaneously on the Youtoo.com website and on the Youtoo app.  If you integrate your Twitter credentials on Youtoo.com, you may also push your message to your Twitter account where it will appear as a "tweet". As part of your Social Shout, you can also share your profile picture and a selection of badges and icon that will be seen together with your Shout when it scrolls on the lower portion of the TV screen or on the social network.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>Submitting Fame Spots will always be free, as will your ability to share those Fame Spots in other social media outlets.  However, if you wish to guarantee that your Fame Spot is seen, you will have the opportunity to spend Youtoo credits to purchase various time slots for your approved Fame Spots.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <h3>14) Can my Fame Spot™ include music?</h3>
                    <p>When we launch, we simply can’t allow viewers to include music in their Fame Spots for legal reasons.  If we air song on our channel to which we have not previously secured the broadcast rights, we will be in violation of copyright laws here in the US.  However, in the coming months we will begin negotiating with the music labels for the right to air shortened versions of popular songs in conjunction with your Fame Spots.  Naturally we value your opinion on this matter and hope you take the time to tell us which songs you think we should make available to users like yourself.  Please click here to submit your requests for artists and/or songs you might like to include in your Fame Spots.  We will take your suggestions to the music labels.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>You will have multiple opportunities to share your Fame Spots with friends and family.  Naturally when you register with Youtoo.com, your friends will be able to see all of your Fame Spots when they go to your profile page at Youtoo.com.  In addition, you can link your Facebook, Twitter, and youtube.com accounts to your Youtoo.com account.  When you do, you can elect to have your Fame Spots pushed to any one of your other social media outlets simultaneously.  Therefore, anybody following you on Twitter or Facebook will see your Fame Spots there as well.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>To be eligible for airing on TV, Fame Spots must comply with technical, editorial, and regulatory standards.  From a technical perspective, they must be 15 seconds in length.  The built-in counters on the Youtoo app and the recorder at Youtoo.com will help users ensure they meet this standard.   From an editorial perspective, Youtoo will not accept Fame Spots that contain hate speech, derogatory comments, disparaging racial comments or other inappropriate language.  From a Federal regulatory perspective, Youtoo will not be allowed to air profanity, nudity, or gratuitous acts of violence.  Last of all, your response to a Fame Spot topic must be relevant to the topic you select.    <br><a href='#top' class='back'>back to top</a>

                    <p>Yes.  Youtoo currently has 3 patents pending on its technology.
